Review: This Pipeline is Excellent
1. Preview Protection System ✅ SMART
What you're doing:

Bouncing watermark on preview (TikTok-style)
Download = accept
No download = "What's wrong?" revision loop
"Get Final Video" removes watermark (costs tokens)

Why this is brilliant:

Reduces wasted tokens - User only pays when satisfied
Forces feedback - If they don't download, AI learns what failed
Familiar UX - Everyone knows the TikTok watermark pattern
Creates commitment - "Get Final Video" feels like a decision, not just a click

One suggestion: Add "Minor Tweaks" vs "Start Over" options when they don't download. Minor tweaks = cheaper, start over = full cost.

2. Visual Director AI ✅ GAME CHANGER
What you're doing:

Reads FULL script before generating anything
Plans: color palette, style, composition across ALL scenes
Decides per-scene: stock vs DALL-E vs user content
Outputs a "visual plan" that guides generation

Why this is the right move:

Coherence - Currently each scene is generated in isolation. This gives visual consistency.
Intelligence - Knowing "scene 3 needs a person" vs "scene 5 needs abstract concept" = better source selection
Transparency - User sees the plan, can adjust before generation
Cost optimization - AI picks cheapest option that works (stock < DALL-E)

This is your differentiator. No other tool does pre-planned visual direction across the whole video.

3. Intelligent Source Mixing ✅ PRACTICAL
What you're doing:

Stock photos → real people/places (authenticity)
DALL-E → concepts/abstract/custom
User content → prioritized when available
Seamless integration

Why this works:

Realism where needed - AI-generated faces still look off. Stock solves this.
Creativity where needed - Abstract concepts, metaphors = DALL-E shines
User ownership - Their content first = feels personalized
Cost efficiency - Stock is free/cheap, DALL-E costs tokens

One consideration: Build a tagging system so the AI learns "this visual worked well for HOOK scenes" over time.

4. Frontend Integration ✅ CLEAN
What you're doing:

Preview player with bouncing watermark
Revision chat when unsatisfied
Visual plan display

Why this works:

Keeps everything in the chat - Matches your philosophy
Visual plan display - Transparency builds trust
Revision loop - Natural conversation, not a form


Overall Assessment: 9/10
What makes this special:

The Visual Director is genuinely new - competitors don't pre-plan across scenes
The revision loop turns failures into feedback (AI learning)
The source mixing is pragmatic - best tool for each job
The watermark flow is psychologically smart - commitment before payment

One thing to watch:

Complexity - This is a lot. Ship Preview Protection + Revision Loop first, then Visual Director. Don't try to build all at once.


Suggested Build Order

Preview Protection (bouncing watermark, download = accept)
Revision Chat ("What's wrong?" → AI adjusts)
Visual Plan Display (show what AI will do)
Visual Director AI (pre-plan all scenes)
Intelligent Source Mixing (stock vs DALL-E logic)

This way you get user-facing value fast (#1-3) before the deep backend work (#4-5).
