Below is a single paste-ready master spec you can give to Replit. It includes everything that will help your mission: script-first editorial intelligence, legal asset scraping with proof, clean scene-based UI, post-ready outputs, and guardrails so the AI doesn’t drift.

⸻

REPLIT MASTER SPEC — “Post Assembly” (Script → Visuals → Edit → Post)

0) Mission (what this app is actually for)

Build an app that turns user-provided content (podcast, transcript, article, or link) into postable short-form content where:

Script decides everything → then visuals are chosen to match the script → then the video is assembled.

This is not a random clipper. It is an editorial system.

Core outcome:
	•	post-ready 9:16 video(s)
	•	subtitles burned in
	•	caption + hashtags
	•	attribution/credits when required
	•	multiple outputs per input (different angles, no overlap)

⸻

1) Non-negotiable Core Rule

Script → Visual Intent → Asset Selection (licensed) → Edit → Export → Post

❌ No “cut first, think later”
❌ No random stock visuals
✅ Every visual must have a “why” tied to the script

⸻

2) Product Inputs

User can provide any of:
	1.	Upload: podcast audio/video file
	2.	Paste transcript text
	3.	Paste an article URL / PDF URL
	4.	Paste a video URL (optional, user-supplied source content)

User also sets:
	•	tone (default: “intelligent, calm, sly when earned”)
	•	length (15/30/60 seconds)
	•	mode: Educational or Skit/Podcast/Short film
	•	optional: required points / “must say”

⸻

3) Two Modes (mandatory fork)

Mode A — Educational
	•	No characters required
	•	Visuals are supporting context (B-roll style)
	•	Output is a clean explainer video

Mode B — Skit / Podcast / Short Film
	•	Scene-based structure
	•	Optional character models per character (or None)
	•	User chooses a setting per scene tied to the script

⸻

4) The AI System (tiered, so it’s actually good)

A) “Editor Model” (high quality)

Responsibilities:
	•	understand intent
	•	write the script
	•	enforce wording precision
	•	output scene plan + visual intent + tags

B) “Worker Model” (cheaper)

Responsibilities:
	•	metadata cleanup
	•	tagging
	•	caption variants
	•	platform hashtags

Hard rule:
Editor produces structured plan → Workers never change meaning.

⸻

5) Script Requirements (strict)
	•	Script length target: 60 words
	•	Allowed range: 50–70 words
	•	Max: 100 tokens
	•	Hook in first 2 seconds
	•	Flowing spoken language (no bullets)
	•	Calm landing, no forced CTA

Tone rules:
	•	intelligent
	•	calm
	•	confident
	•	lightly sly if “character mode” is enabled
	•	never juvenile, no sex/butt/fart humor, no profanity by default

If content becomes graphic:

“The story gets graphic here — we’re skipping that part.”

⸻

6) Visual Intent Requirements (this fixes the “Pexels mismatch” problem)

The AI must output visual intent per scene, not random images.

For each scene the AI outputs:
	•	scene_purpose (why it exists)
	•	visual_intent (what viewer should feel)
	•	asset_type (image or video)
	•	search_tags (generic, non-branded)
	•	duration_sec

⸻

7) Scene-Based UI (clean, postable-first)

For Mode B (Skit/Podcast/Short Film), after script generation:

For each scene show:

Title: “Pick the setting for this scene”
Under it: “Why this scene matters” (1–2 lines)

Then show 3–6 setting options:
	•	full-screen previews
	•	yellow border around each selectable option
	•	user chooses one quickly

The user can answer with one word and the app still produces a coherent full output (sensible defaults).

Theme requirements:
	•	green background
	•	yellow text
	•	yellow input text (including what user types)
	•	minimal layout, no clutter

⸻

8) Legal Scraper (Option 2) — MUST store proof

We do not scrape random internet media.

Hard legality rule

Download media ONLY if we can store:
	1.	source page URL
	2.	license name (exact)
	3.	license URL / explicit reuse statement
	4.	commercial use allowed (boolean)
	5.	attribution required + attribution text if required
If any are missing → reject (don’t download).

License whitelist

	•	Public Domain / CC0

REJECT:
	•	NC

Asset DB record structure (required)

9) Wikimedia Commons Scraper Fix (why we only get a few)

Implement the correct 2-step API:
	1.	Search files only:
