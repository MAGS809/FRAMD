Got it — this is the important clarification.
I’ll strip Israel / Palestine out as content, and keep it only as a worked example of how the system thinks.

Below is the clean, generic app idea, where any ideology / social topic can be plugged in — Israel/Palestine just happens to be one use case you care about.

You can paste this directly to Replit or any builder.

App Idea: Context Engine

One-Line Description

An AI system that turns long-form content and public discourse into short, precise social videos by writing the argument first, then cutting only the footage that supports it — eliminating random clips, rage bait, and shallow edits.

⸻

Core Principle (This Is the Whole Point)

No clip exists without a script.
No script exists without reasoning.

The app does not “find viral moments.”
It constructs meaning, then visualizes it.

⸻

What Problem This Solves

Most AI clip tools:
	•	cut based on loud moments
	•	chase engagement signals
	•	produce shallow, repetitive content
	•	disconnect visuals from meaning

This app instead:
	•	starts with ideas
	•	respects complexity
	•	creates clarity without oversimplifying
	•	scales thought, not noise

⸻

What the App Actually Does

1. Inputs (Flexible)
	•	Long-form video (podcasts, lectures, debates, interviews)
	•	Optional user notes / outline / philosophy
	•	Optional external clips (news, hearings, archives)

No AI-generated imagery.
Only real footage, used intentionally.

⸻

2. Transcript + Idea Mapping

The AI:
	•	transcribes the entire source
	•	identifies claims, assumptions, incentives, contradictions
	•	maps ideas, not just keywords

This produces an Idea Graph, not a highlight reel.

⸻

3. Script-First Intelligence (Non-Negotiable)

For each viable idea, the AI:
	1.	Writes a short script (15–60 seconds)
	2.	Script must contain:
	•	a hook (clarity, not shock)
	•	a core claim
	•	a grounding explanation
	•	a closing line that reinforces meaning
	3.	Outputs:
	•	exact timestamps required
	•	tone (calm, dry, ironic, reflective, etc.)
	•	visual intent (supportive, neutral, contextual)

Pipeline logic (locked):
Script → Timestamps → Clips

⸻

4. Clip Selection & Editing
	•	Clips are pulled only if they support the script
	•	Visuals never contradict the argument
	•	No filler B-roll
	•	No random jump cuts
	•	Pacing is deliberate, not frantic

Formats supported:
	•	9:16 (Shorts / Reels / TikTok)
	•	1:1 (carousel video)
	•	4:5 (feed)

⸻

5. Caption & Context Layer

For each output, AI generates:
	•	one restrained caption
	•	one clarifying sentence
	•	one reflective question

No slogans.
No rage bait.
No hashtags spam.

⸻

6. Identity Layer (Optional)

Each project can define:
	•	a closing badge
	•	a recurring phrase
	•	a consistent tonal signature

This is identity, not branding.

⸻

Guardrails (System-Level Rules)

The AI must NEVER:
	•	chase outrage
	•	generalize groups
	•	argue theology
	•	oversimplify structural issues
	•	cut footage before reasoning

The AI must ALWAYS:
	•	distinguish ideas from people
	•	prioritize clarity over virality
	•	explain incentives, not assign blame
	•	remain calm even when discussing conflict

⸻

Why This Works
	•	Appeals to people tired of noise
	•	Makes complex topics accessible without flattening them
	•	Produces repeatable quality
	•	Scales across any domain:
	•	politics
	•	culture
	•	philosophy
	•	economics
	•	social analysis
	•	media criticism

Israel/Palestine is one example, not the product.

⸻

Technical Direction (High Level)
	•	Python-based orchestration (terminal-driven)
	•	FFmpeg for precise cutting
	•	OpenAI for:
	•	transcript reasoning
	•	script generation
	•	idea ranking
	•	No UI dependency required
	•	Can later plug into n8n, Replit, or cloud runners

⸻

End Goal

Not to “go viral.”

To raise the average level of thought in public spaces — one clip at a time.

⸻

If you want next, I can:
	•	turn this into a Replit build plan
	•	write the system prompt that enforces this philosophy
	•	design the CLI interface (what you type in terminal)
	•	or map how any topic gets plugged in cleanly

Just say which one.
