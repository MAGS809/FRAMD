Framd Pricing & Product - Fully Fleshed Out
The Pricing Philosophy
Make it feel generous. Make money on power users. Never make users feel nickel-and-dimed.

CLIPPER - Fully Fleshed Out
How It Works

User uploads source (podcast, long video, transcript, link)
AI asks: "How many clips do you want?"

Options: 1, 3, 5, 10, Custom


AI analyzes and identifies best moments
AI shows clip previews (watermarked)
User selects which ones to export

Clipper Pricing

Clipper Output Options
User can choose:

Aspect ratio: 9:16 (TikTok), 1:1 (Instagram), 16:9 (YouTube)
Number of clips: 1-10 (or custom)
Clip length: 15, 30, 45, or 60 seconds

The "Multiple Clips" Flow
AI: "I found 7 strong moments in your video. 
     How many clips do you want me to create?"

User: "5"

AI: "Here are the top 5 clips (watermarked previews):
     
     1. [0:42-1:12] Hook about productivity
     2. [3:15-3:45] Story about failure
     3. [7:20-7:50] Key insight moment
     4. [12:05-12:35] Emotional peak
     5. [18:30-19:00] Call to action

User: Selects 1, 2, 4

AI: "Exporting 3 clips... Done! (7 free exports remaining today)"

RESKIN - Fully Fleshed Out
How It Works

User uploads reference video (ad they want to copy)
AI analyzes:

Structure/pacing
Visual style
Text placement
Transitions
Hook/body/CTA format


User provides their content:

Their product/service
Their branding
Their message


AI generates preview (watermarked)
User can revise (unlimited free previews)
User exports (costs tokens based on length)

Explainers
Product announcements
Quick social content
Ideas that don't need existing video

AI writes script
AI selects stock video + generates custom images
User previews (watermarked)
User exports (10 tokens for 30 sec)

Why it's cheap: No Runway API, just stock footage assembly.
