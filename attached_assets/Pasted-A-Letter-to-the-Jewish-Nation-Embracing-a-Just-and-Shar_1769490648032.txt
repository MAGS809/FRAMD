A Letter to the Jewish Nation: Embracing a Just and Shared Future

Dear Two-State Solution Believers,

 The world speaks of the two-state solution as if it is a lost opportunity, as if it only recently slipped from our grasp. But that is a misconception. A state cannot be built on the land of a people who do not accept it as justice. And for many Palestinians, the two-state solution has never been justice—it has been the illusion of a future they were never meant to control (European Union, 2024).

  Israel has fundamentally supported a Palestinian state, yet they have done everything in their power to stop the formation of one. Because of many factors, including the history between the two peoples, a strong Palestinian state is not in the modern Zionists’ best interest. Thus, this contradiction in Israeli society exists to undermine peace and create distance from the intended reasons of this all.     

 What are the true non-negotiables of both sides? For the Palestinians it’s division of the land, for the Israelis it's the necessary reassurance of security on the land. What best reflects both parties in this case, is a state or federation, where no one rules over the other, where Jews, Muslims, and Christians govern together, and where security does not come from walls and weapons, but from justice and shared power. If the Land of Israel is truly holy, then let us build a system that reflects its holiness, not one that divides, oppresses, or reduces it to politics alone.

Instead of separation, a real solution must be built on coexistence under a just and agreed-upon system.

  For generations, the Zionist regime has lived by the sword. People are taught security means military strength, that Jewish survival depends on control. But where has that led us? To an endless cycle of war, to a state that is militarized instead of secure, to a place where young Israelis must live in fear of rockets or the next military draft (UN Secretary-General Report, 2023).

  The importance of discovering the root causes that undermine Israel and the Jewish people is the top priority to really achieve peace. It starts by reflecting on the environment, and understanding why there is a lack of empathy, brotherhood, and lasting stability in this region. The answer will be different for everyone but try not to blame others or your own, now is the time to be objective and thoughtful so we can move on from this century-old problem.      

Why This is the Best Future for Palestinians

 For Palestinians, this is a future of the end to occupation, checkpoints, and military rule. It is a future where they have a voice in government, land ownership rights, and legal equality. A future built on the dignity of fighting for what was right, not dependency.

  It is human to want peace, yet every step has been to cast aside doubts of a two state solution that was created to conquer and divide their people. It is inhumane to continue to ask you to accept 

This is not a dream, it is the only future that breaks the cycle.

A Final Call to the Jewish Nation

  History belongs to those who dare to reimagine it. The Jewish mission is to prepare the world for what’s to come and by pushing for a shared vision of peace in the Holy Land, in which all who believe in the spiritual component that exists there, we can then truly focus on what comes next. 

Will we continue chasing a failed dream, or will we finally build a future that we all can be proud of?

The answer is in our hearts and it’s up to us.

Sincerely,
Alon Ben-Meir II
