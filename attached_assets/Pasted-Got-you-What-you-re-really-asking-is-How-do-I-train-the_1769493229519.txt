Got you. What you’re really asking is:

✅ How do I “train” the AI’s brain (inside the prompt) so it understands WHY it failed and doesn’t repeat the mistake
—not just “rewrite this one script.”

So here’s the way to do it: you don’t just give it instructions… you give it a correction framework:
	1.	what it did wrong
	2.	what it should do instead
	3.	what patterns to avoid
	4.	what patterns to repeat
	5.	what success looks like

That’s how you “edit the brain” through its filters.

⸻

✅ THE “BRAIN EDIT” PROMPT (COPY/PASTE)

Use this exactly as your first message before asking it to rewrite.

⸻

🧠 “LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKE” SYSTEM PROMPT

You previously wrote a script about Israel/Palestine, but your output did not align with the user’s intent.
Before rewriting, you must analyze your mistake, update your reasoning, and then regenerate.

✅ Step 1: Identify the errors in your previous output

Your last script failed because:

ERROR A — Generic peace-commercial tone
You wrote safe, inspirational lines that sound like a documentary montage, instead of a sharp political + spiritual argument.

ERROR B — Flattened power dynamics
You treated both sides as equal actors, instead of recognizing Israel’s government/state power has the strongest leverage and thus greater responsibility.

ERROR C — Missing the key logical strike
You did not include the core argument:

If Palestinians are not on board with the two-state solution, it’s dead — regardless of Israeli/Jewish enthusiasm.

ERROR D — Wrong framing of holiness
You did not connect the land’s holiness to moral obligation and shared future.
You drifted toward secular “unity language” instead.

ERROR E — Too clean / unrealistic jump
You jumped from conflict imagery to “federation equals peace” without acknowledging the difficulty, sacrifice, and truth required.

⸻

✅ Step 2: Replace your old reasoning with this upgraded model

Use this reasoning to rewrite:
	•	The “peace process” is not a genuine people’s movement; it is managed by states and media.
	•	The two-state solution is a slogan that has not produced dignity or enthusiasm for both peoples.
	•	A solution is invalid if Palestinians do not accept it.
	•	Critique state policy and dominance structures without demonizing individuals.
	•	Tie the land’s holiness to responsibility and justice, not conquest or propaganda.
	•	The ending should be a philosophical challenge, not a motivational poster.

⸻

✅ Step 3: Hard constraints (do not violate)
	•	Maintain Socrates (curious, probing) and Plato (reflective, authoritative).
	•	6 scenes, 5–7 seconds each.
	•	Keep VISUAL and CUT lines.
	•	Avoid propaganda imagery.
	•	No overly sentimental unity slogans.
	•	No “all sides are equally responsible” framing.
	•	Include at least one line referencing:
	1.	peace being controlled from above
	2.	Palestinians not agreeing → two-state isn’t viable
	3.	security comes from justice
	4.	Israeli government power / responsibility
	5.	holiness of the land tied to moral duty

⸻

✅ Step 4: Rewrite the script (final output only)

Now regenerate the script with the above corrections.

⸻

✅ WHY THIS WORKS (the real “brain edit”)

This forces the AI to:

🔥 “self-diagnose”

It doesn’t just receive your preferences, it admits the failure pattern.

🔥 “swap the internal template”

It replaces “generic peace PSA” with your actual structure:
	•	power imbalance
	•	state responsibility
	•	spiritual framing
	•	people vs governments/media

🔥 “lock it with constraints”

Constraints stop it from defaulting to safe corporate language.

⸻

✅ EXTRA: If you want it to never drift again

Add this final line to the prompt:

“If you slip into generic unity language or equal-blame framing, stop and rewrite before output.”

That’s like putting a guardrail in its head.

⸻

If you want, I can rewrite your original 6 scenes myself with the corrected logic and keep it cinematic—so you can compare “bad AI version vs fixed version” line-by-line.
