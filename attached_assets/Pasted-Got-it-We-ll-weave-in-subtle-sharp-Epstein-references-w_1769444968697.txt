Got it. We'll weave in subtle, sharp Epstein references with a humorous, detached tone fitting for an Adult Swim audience. Let’s get this satirical whirlwind rolling. SCRIPT READY: THE UNBOTHERED PRESIDENT INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY [VISUAL: The president, feet kicked up on the Resolute Desk, munches on a bag of cheese puffs. Papers are scattered haphazardly. A large, blinking button on the desk is labeled "CRISIS OVERRIDE—DO NOT PRESS."] CHIEF OF STAFF (panicked, pacing) Mr. President, reports are flooding in. Israel’s... well, let’s just say they’re doing *some stuff* again. The press is gonna roast us unless we— PRESIDENT (interrupting) What’s their situation? Bombs? Walls? Spicy hummus? CHIEF OF STAFF Bombs *and* walls, sir. And they're likely buying... “extra vacation homes” for certain—uh, ahem—“friends.” [VISUAL: A framed autographed photo of Jeffrey Epstein on the desk. A Post-It slapped over it says, "NEVER HAPPENED."] PRESIDENT (waving it off) Listen, Jerry, just send out the boilerplate statement. You know the one: "We wholeheartedly support the right to aggressively...defend themselves. Blah blah democracy, peace, justice—whatever buzzword plays well this week." CHIEF OF STAFF But, sir, the United Nations is about to— PRESIDENT (unwrapping another cheese puff) Pfft. The U.N.? What are they gonna do, post another strongly worded tweet? #WorldSadEmoji? Relax, Jerry. [VISUAL: Camera zooms to the blinking override button as the president casually hovers a cheese-dusted finger over it.] CHIEF OF STAFF Sir. Please don't hit the button. Last time, you accidentally legalized flamethrowers for children. PRESIDENT And sales for "KidzToast Inc." are through the roof. You're welcome, economy. [VISUAL: Frenzied news chyron flashing: "BREAKING: CHILD-PROOF FLAMETHROWERS NOW A BILLION-DOLLAR INDUSTRY."] CHIEF OF STAFF (sighs, defeated) Fine. And Epstein’s “clients”? If this leaks, we’re toast. PRESIDENT (leans back, smirking) Jerry, Jerry, Jerry. Here’s the thing. No one remembers what I did *yesterday.* Do you think anyone’s gonna care or even notice I’m pals with— [VISUAL: A gaggle of reporters burst into the room, snapping photos. One yells: “What about your connections to Epstein?!” The president turns, breaking the fourth wall.] PRESIDENT (deadpan, to camera) —oh, for crying out loud. Him? Never even flew coach with the guy. [VISUAL: Quick cutaway to a grainy security cam footage of the president clearly shaking hands with Epstein on a yacht. Timestamp: "TWO MONTHS AGO."] CHIEF OF STAFF (grabbing his chest) Kill me now. PRESIDENT (presses button on desk) Don’t worry, Jerry. Crisis overridden. Ta-da! [VISUAL: The lights flicker ominously. Alarms blare. Outside the window, a helicopter carrying a suspiciously Epstein-esque figure covered by a sheet takes off in a cloud of smoke while the reporters scream.] ROLL CREDITS.
